# Java Data Validation and Output Display Practice Project

This repository contains a Java practice project that focuses on data validation and output display techniques. The project was designed to help you enhance your skills in Java programming and explore various techniques for validating user input and displaying relevant output.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to create a program that interacts with the user through the console, validates their input, and displays appropriate output based on the program's specifications. You'll be able to practice the following key concepts:

- User input and output handling
- Data validation and error handling
- Conditional statements for decision-making
- Utilizing Java's built-in classes for scanning user input

## Getting Started

To run this Java project on your local machine, follow these steps:

        1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

        ```
        git clone https://github.com/rashusharda/dataValidation.git
        ```

        2. **Compile the Code:** Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java code using the Java compiler. For example:

        ```
        javac sourceCode.java
        ```

        3. **Run the Program:** After successfully compiling the code, run the Java program:

        ```
        java sourceCode
        ```

        4. **Follow Console Instructions:** The program will guide you through the input process. Make sure to provide input as per the program's specifications.

## Program Workflow

1. The program will prompt the user for input through the console.
2. It will then perform data validation on the user's input to ensure it meets the program's requirements.
3. Based on the validation results, the program will display relevant output or error messages.
4. You will have the opportunity to explore different scenarios and test various input types.

## Project Structure

- `sourceCode.java`: This is the main Java file containing the project code. You can explore this file to understand the logic behind data validation and output display.

## Contributing

Feel free to experiment with the code and expand upon this project. You can contribute by adding new features, improving error handling, or enhancing the user experience. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please create a pull request or open an issue in this repository.

## Acknowledgments

This project was created as a practice exercise to learn and apply different Java techniques for data validation and output display. It is not intended for production use but rather as a learning tool. Feel free to adapt and modify the code to suit your learning objectives.

Have fun exploring Java programming techniques and honing your skills with this practice project!
